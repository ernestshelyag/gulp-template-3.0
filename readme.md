A template where there is almost nothing superfluous.

##Quick start

    npm i 
    npm start
    
You do not need the build command because at any time after "npm start" you have a folder "public" with all minified files.

##Other commands

    npm i -g npm-check-updates
    ncu -u
    
If this is a new project, you can update the version of the used packages (before "npm i") with the command "ncu -u". Need preinstalled npm-check-updates (npm i -g npm-check-updates).

##About this template

* Gulp version: 4.0.0-alpha.3
* Node version: v8.11.1

Of course it can work with other versions of Node

    gulp -v
    node -v

Commands to check your versions.
